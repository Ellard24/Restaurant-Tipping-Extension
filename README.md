Getting Started- Elimate Tipping Web Extension
------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
Since our project is a web extension written for the Chrome web browser, the only dependency you will need is the Chrome web browser itself. 

--------------------------
Installation: 

Once the Chrome web browser is installed, you will need to click on the "Customize and Control Google Chrome" button in the top right corner. Its base UI representation is three horizontal lines. In these settings you will need to navigate to the Extension tab on the left side and then make sure you enable the "Developer Mode". Without developer mode enabled you can not load in our web extension. 

The next step requires you to take our zip file and unzip it to a location of your choice. You can then press the "Load unpacked extension" button in the extension page and point it towards the unzipped directory. It's important that it finds the manifest file so make sure that if its located within a directory within another directory, that you choose the innermost directory. 

Now that you have properly installed the web extension, make sure you press the enable button on the right side of the extension. 
You will notice that a new button has been added to your Google Chrome Web Browser, a hand with a money symbol above it. Click that and you will be able to interact with the extension. 

Feel free to input any address whether a street address, zip code, etc. 
After locating the specified address, all restaurants near that location will be marked with arrows. 

A grey arrow represents a restaurant that has not been registered as in support of tipping or not. A green arrow represents that the
restaurant does not support tipping and the red arrow represents that they do support tipping. If you find a restaurant that either supports or doesn't support tipping be sure to find them on the map and press either "No Tipping" or "Tipping Allowed". There is also
the option to dispute a restaurant's tipping status if you find that it is incorrect.
